# Intro to Statistics for Forensic Science

These materials were created for "The Basics of DNA Evidence" workshop taught by the Forensic University in Spring 2022.


## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to
- explain what are probabilities and how they are computed in practice
- select the correct probability rule depending on the situation: product rule, addition rule or conditional probabilities rule
- describe the main fallacies when interpreting probabilities

## Syllabus

| Topic | Key take-away points | Lecture notes |
| :---:   | :---: | :---:       |
| 1. What is probability? | i) When it comes to probabilities, we do not trust our gut, we trust the formulas; ii) We estimate population probabilities from observed frequencies in samples; iii) The chosen sample is very important | [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/1what-is-prob.html) | 
| 2. How do we combine probabilities? | i) Product rule: we can calculate the probability of simultaneous events when they are independent; ii) Addition rule: we can calculate the probability of different disjoint events  |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/2combining-probs.html) |
